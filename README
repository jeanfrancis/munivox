Govfresh Voice is a cloud telephony application specifically engineered for local governments.

Govfresh Voice is written in PHP and makes use of the following tools / components:

* The Tropo WebAPI platform (http://www.tropo.com).
* The PHP WebAPI library for building Tropo applications (http://github.com/tropo/tropo-webapi-php).
* The Limonade Framework for PHP applications (http://www.limonade-php.net/).

Govfresh Voice makes it easy for small local governments to implement a sophisticated cloud-based PBX system with the following features:

* Set up unlimited numbered extensions that can forward to any cell phone or landline.
* Accept inbound calls from landline phones, cell phones, Skype or SIP-based phones.
* Enable speech recognition, to allow callers to select an extension or service using their voice instead of touch tone keys. 
* Enable voice mail recording with message recordings routed to specified users.
* Enable transcription of voice mail recordings with transcription results e-mailed to specified users.
* Enable "screen pops" with call transfers, to allow government employees to see information on inbound calls.
